# Your-Chemist
This is an app that allows people to find chemists in their town that have specific drugs, if they don’t have them, the user has the possibility of adding the drug to the list of medicines needed in their town. Pharmacists can use that to know which medicine they can buy or import, later I will implement a cloud function that will send a notification to the user once a chemist in their area has that drug.

## Usage and Components
When opening the app, one has a fragment where they can type in the medicines that they are looking for, then there is a fragments with the results that appears, if that drug is not available in the town, a text view will pop up and the user can click to add the drug to list of those needed in their town.
For chemists one will have to create an account and set up information about one’s chemist shop, after that they can add medicine that is in their shop and see medicine that is needed in their town.

## Improvement that will be made
·        Add email and password verification;
·        searchViews to all the recyclerViews;
·        Material design;
·        A better database design (we might be making more read and write that we should);
·        Notification for users;
·        A map, so that the app can get the user location directly and avoid input mistakes;
·        Details about in demand drugs and allow chemists to see if another pharmacist already have them;
·        Cloud functions to delete in demand drug after they in the database for 6 months;
